# Multiple of a number
A number is a multiple of $n$ if it is the product of a counting number and $n$
# Divisible by a number
if a number $m$ is a multiple of $n$, then $m$ is divisible by $n$.
# Divisibility Test
A number is divisible by:
- $2$ if the last digit is $0, 2, 4, 6,$ or $8$.
- $3$ if the sum of the digits is divisible by $3$.
- $5$ if the last digit is $5$ or $0$.
- $6$ if it is divisible by both $2$ and $3$.
- $10$ if it ends with $0$.
# Factors
In the expression $a.b$, both $a$ and $b$ are called factors. if $a.b=m$, both $a$ and $b$ are factors of $m$.
# Prime Number and Composite Number
A prime number is a counting number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and the number itself. The prime numbers less than $20$ are $2$, $3$, $5$, $7$, $11$, $13$, $17$, and $19$.

A composite number is a counting number greater than $1$ that is not prime. A composite number has factors either than $1$ and itself.
