A fraction is a way to represent parts of a whole. A fraction is written $\frac{a}{b}$. $a$ is the numerator and $b$ is the denominator.
The denominator $b$ is the number of equal parts the whole has been divided into, and the numerator $a$ indicates how many parts are included.
# Equivalent Fractions Property
Fractions that have the same value are equivalent fractions. if a, b, and c are numbers where $b\neq0$, $c\neq0$, then $\frac{a}{b}=$ $\frac{a.c}{b.c}$ and $\frac{a.c}{b.c}=$ $\frac{a}{b}$
# Simplified Fraction
A simplified fraction is one where there are no common factors, other than 1, in its numerator and denominator.
# Fraction Multiplication
if a, b, c and d are numbers where $b\neq0$, and $d\neq0$, then $\frac{a}{b}.\frac{c}{d}=\frac{ac}{bd}$ 
To multiply fraction, multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.
# Fraction Division
if a, b, c and d are numbers where $b\neq0$, $c\neq0$, and $d\neq0$, then $\frac{a}{b}\div\frac{c}{d}=\frac{a}{b}.\frac{d}{c}$ 
To divide fraction, we multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second
