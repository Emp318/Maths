A fraction is a way to represent parts of a whole. A fraction is written $\frac{a}{b}$. $a$ is the numerator and $b$ is the denominator.
The denominator $b$ is the number of equal parts the whole has been divided into, and the numerator $a$ indicates how many parts are included.
# Equivalent Fractions Property
Fractions that have the same value are equivalent fractions. if a, b, and c are numbers where $b\neq0$, $c\neq0$, then $\frac{a}{b}=$ $\frac{a.c}{b.c}$ and $\frac{a.c}{b.c}=$ $\frac{a}{b}$
# Simplified Fraction
A simplified fraction is one where there are no common factors, other than 1, in its numerator and denominator.
# Fraction Multiplication
if a, b, c and d are numbers where $b\neq0$, and $d\neq0$, then $\frac{a}{b}.\frac{c}{d}=\frac{ac}{bd}$ 
To multiply fraction, multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.
# Fraction Division
if a, b, c and d are numbers where $b\neq0$, $c\neq0$, and $d\neq0$, then $\frac{a}{b}\div\frac{c}{d}=\frac{a}{b}.\frac{d}{c}$ 
To divide fraction, we multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second.
# Complex Fraction
A complex fraction is a fraction in which the numerator or the denominator contains a fraction.
# Fraction Addition and Subtraction
if a, b, and c are numbers where $c\neq0$, then 
$\frac{a}{c}+\frac{b}{c}=\frac{a+b}{c}$ and $\frac{a}{c}-\frac{b}{c}=\frac{a-b}{c}$ 
To add or subtract fractions, add or subtract the numerators and place the result over the common denominator.
# Least Common Denominator
The least common denominator (LCD) of two fractions is the smallest number that can be used as a common denominator of the fractions. The LCD of the two fractions is the least common multiple (LCM) of their denominators. After finding the LCD of the two or more fractions, we convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD. This allows us to add and subtract fractions because their denominators will be the same!
# Placement of Negative Sign in a Fraction
For any positive numbers $a$ and $b$,
$\frac{-a}{b}=\frac{a}{-b}=-\frac{a}{b}$
# Example
1. Add: $\frac{7}{12} + \frac{5}{18}$
# Solution
$12=2.2.3$
$18=2.3.3$
------------
LCD = $2.2.3.3$
LCD = 36
$\frac{7}{12}+\frac{5}{18}$
$\frac{7.3}{12.3}+\frac{5.2}{18.2}$
$\frac{21}{36}+\frac{10}{36}$
$\frac{31}{36}$
