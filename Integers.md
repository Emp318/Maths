# Opposite Notation 
$-a$ means the opposite of the number a. The notation $-a$ is read as the "opposite of $a$."
# Absolute Value
The absolute value of a number is its distance from 0 on the number line. The absolute value of a number $n$ is written as $|n|$ as $|n| \geq 0$ for all numbers. Absolute values are always greater than or equal to zero. 
The absolute value of a number is never negative because distance cannot be negative. The only number with absolute value equal to zero is the number zero itself because the distance from 0 to 0 on the number line is zero units.
# Integers 
The whole numbers and their opposites are called the integers. The integers are the numbers $... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3...$
# Subtraction Property
Subtracting a number is the same as adding its opposite.
$a-b=a+(-b)$
# Multiplication and Division of Signed Numbers
For multiplication and division of two signed numbers:

| **Same signs**    | **Result**   |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| **Two Positives** | **Positive** |
| **Two negatives** | **Positive** |
if the signs are the same, the result is positive.

| **Same signs**            | **Result**   |
| ------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Positive and negative** | **Negative** |
| **Negative and positive** | **Negative** |
# Multiplication by $-1$
Multiplying a number by $-1$ gives its opposite
$-1a=-a$
# Use Integers in Application
1. Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood.
2. Identify what we are asked to find.
3. Write a phrase that gives the information to find it.
4. Translate the phrase to an expression.
5. Simplify the expression.
6. Answer the question with a complete sentence.
## Example
1. In the morning, the temperature in Kendallville, Indiana was 11 degrees. By mid-afternoon, the temperature had dropped to -9 degrees. What was the difference in the morning and afternoon temperature?

### Solution
The difference of the morning and afternoon temperatures is the difference of 11 and -9
$11-(-9)$
20
The difference in temperatures was 20 degrees
