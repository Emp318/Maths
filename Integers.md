# Opposite Notation 
$-a$ means the opposite of the number a. The notation $-a$ is read as the "opposite of $a$."
# Absolute Value
The absolute value of a number is its distance from 0 on the number line. The absolute value of a number $n$ is written as $|n|$ as $|n| \geq 0$ for all numbers. Absolute values are always greater than or equal to zero. 
The absolute value of a number is never negative because distance cannot be negative. The only number with absolute value equal to zero is the number zero itself because the distance from 0 to 0 on the number line is zero units.
# Integers 
The whole numbers and their opposites are called the integers. The integers are the numbers $... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3...$
