Decimals are another way of writing fractions whose denominators are powers of ten. Each digit of a decimal corresponds to the place value based on the powers of ten.

# Round Decimals
1. Locate the given place value and mark it with an arrow
2. Underline the digit to the right of the place value.
3. Is the underlined digit greater than or equal to 5?
- Yes: add 1 to the digit in the given place value.
- No: do not change the digit in the given place value.
4. Rewrite the number, deleting all digits to the right of the rounding digit.
# Example
Round $18.379$ to the nearest 
- hundredth 
- tenth
- whole number
# Solution
- to the nearest hundredth

- to the nearest tenth
![[Pasted image 20241021144640.png]]
- to the nearest whole number

# Add and Subtract Decimals
1. Determine the sign of the sum or difference.
2. Write the numbers so the decimal points line up vertically
3. Use zeros as placeholders, as needed.
4. Add or subtract the numbers as if they were whole numbers. Then place the decimal point in the answer under the decimal points in the given numbers.
5. Write the sum or difference with the appropriate sign.
# Example
Add or subtract:
1. $-2.35-41.38$
2. $14.65-20$

# Multiply and Divide Decimals
### Multiply decimals
1. Determine the sign of the product
2. Write in vertical format, lining up the numbers on the right. Multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers, temporarily ignoring the decimal points.
3. Place the decimal point. The number of decimal places in the product is the sum of the number of decimal places in the factors.
4. Write the product with the appropriate sign.
# Example
Multiply: $(-3.9)(4.075)$.
# Solution

# Divide decimals
1. Determine the sign of the quotient.
2. Make the divisor a whole number by moving the decimal pint all the way to the right. Move the decimal point in the dividend same number of places by adding zeros as needed.
3. Divide. Place the decimal point in the quotient above the decimal point in the dividend.
4. Write the quotient with the appropriate sign.

# Example
Divide: $-25.65\div(0.06)$.

# Convert Decimals, Fractions, and Percent's 
### Convert a decimal to a proper fraction and a fraction to a decimal.
1. To convert a decimal to a proper fraction, determine the place value of the final digit.
2. Write the fraction.
- numerator: the numbers to the right of the decimal point
- denominator: the place value corresponding to the final digit
3. To convert a fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator of the fraction by the denominator of the fraction.
# Example
write: 
- $0.374$ as a fraction
- $-\frac{5}{8}$ as a decimal.
# Solution

# Percent
A percent is a ratio whose denominator is 100. Percent means per hundred. We use the percent symbol, % to show percent. Since a percent is a ratio, it can easily expressed as a fraction. To convert a percent number to a decimal number, we move the decimal point two places to the left.

To convert a decimal to a percent, we move the decimal two places to the right and then add the percent sign.

# Example 
Convert each:
- percent to a decimal: $62$%, $135$% and $13.7$%. 
- decimal to a percent: $0.51$, $1.25$, and $0.093$.

# Square of a number
if $n^2=m$, then $m$ is the square of $n$. 
# Square Root of a Number
if $n^2=m$, then $n$ is a square root of $m$. Both $10$ and $-10$ are square roots f $100$. S every positive number has two square roots - one positive and one negative. The positive square root is called the principal square root. The radical sign,
